\title{Get unrelated subjects}
\usage{
unrelated(ped, avail = ped$ped$avail)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{A pedigree objects with unique id, father index, mother index}

\item{avail}{Vector of availability status (e.g., genotyped) 0/1 or
TRUE/FALSE}
}
\value{
A vector of the ids of subjects that are unrelated.
}
\description{
Determine set of maximum number of unrelated available subjects from a
pedigree
}
\details{
Determine set of maximum number of unrelated available subjects from a
pedigree, given vectors id, father, and mother for a pedigree structure, and
status vector of T/F for whether each subject is available (e.g. has DNA)

This is a greedy algorithm that uses the kinship matrix, sequentially
removing rows/cols that are non-zero for subjects that have the most number
of zero kinship coefficients (greedy by choosing a row of kinship matrix
that has the most number of zeros, and then remove any cols and their
corresponding rows that are non-zero. To account for ties of the count of
zeros for rows, a random choice is made. Hence, running this function
multiple times can return different sets of unrelated subjects.
