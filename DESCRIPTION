Description: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The initial purpose
	     was to create correlation structures that describe family relationships such 
	     as kinship and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data 
	     in mixed effects models, such as in the coxme function. Also includes a tool
	     for pedigree drawing which is focused on producing compact layouts without 
	     intervention. Recent additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object
	     with various criteria, and kinship for the X chromosome.
